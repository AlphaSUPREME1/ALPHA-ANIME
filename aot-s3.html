<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Attack on Titan Season 3 shifts the story from fighting Titans to uncovering the truth about the world itself. The Survey Corps becomes enemies of the government when they realize the royal family has been hiding critical information from the public. Eren’s Titan powers become even more important as new enemies try to capture him for their own purposes.

This season explores political corruption, hidden history, and the true origin of Titans. The walls that once symbolized safety are now revealed to be part of a much bigger lie. Through powerful flashbacks, viewers learn about Eren’s father and how he stole a mysterious power that would change the fate of humanity forever.

Meanwhile, the Survey Corps fights both human soldiers and Titans in their struggle to reclaim the truth. Old friendships are tested, and new leadership rises as humanity moves closer to understanding its past. Season 3 is a turning point in the series, transforming Attack on Titan from a survival story into a deep, emotional narrative about freedom, lies, and what it truly means to be human.
