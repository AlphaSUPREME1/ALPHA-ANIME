<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Attack on Titan Season 2 dives deeper into the mysteries introduced in the first season. As humanity begins to regain some confidence after Eren’s Titan power is revealed, new threats emerge from unexpected places. Titans suddenly appear inside the walls, raising frightening questions about how they got there. The Survey Corps works tirelessly to defend civilians while also trying to uncover how the Titans are infiltrating their safe zones.

This season also reveals shocking truths about some of the main characters. Reiner, Bertholdt, and Ymir are no longer just fellow soldiers — they are connected to the Titans in ways no one could have imagined. These betrayals change everything, forcing Eren and his friends to question who they can truly trust. The emotional weight of fighting former allies makes the battles even more intense.

Season 2 focuses heavily on loyalty, identity, and sacrifice. Characters are pushed to their limits as they try to protect both humanity and the people they care about. At the same time, hints about the origin of Titans and the world beyond the walls begin to surface. The story becomes darker and more complex, moving away from simple survival into a tale of secrets, hidden enemies, and the tragic cost of war.
