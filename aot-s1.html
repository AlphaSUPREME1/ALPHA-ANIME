<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Attack on Titan Season 1 introduces a dark and intense world where humanity is on the brink of extinction. For more than a hundred years, humans have lived safely behind enormous walls that protect them from giant humanoid creatures called Titans. These terrifying beings devour humans for no clear reason, making the outside world extremely dangerous. The story follows Eren Yeager, a young boy who dreams of exploring the world beyond the walls. His peaceful life is shattered when a colossal Titan appears and breaks through the wall, allowing smaller Titans to invade his city. Eren witnesses his mother being eaten, which fills him with rage and a desire for revenge.

Determined to destroy every Titan, Eren joins the military along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his best friend Armin Arlert. They train to become part of the Survey Corps, a group that fights Titans outside the walls. During their first real battle, Eren seemingly dies, but soon a shocking truth is revealed — he has the ability to transform into a Titan himself. This mysterious power makes him both humanity’s greatest hope and its greatest fear. Season 1 focuses on survival, fear, and humanity’s struggle to fight back against an overwhelming enemy while uncovering the first hints of a much deeper secret behind the Titans.
