<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The Final Season of Attack on Titan brings everything to its dramatic conclusion. The story expands beyond the walls and reveals that the Titans are part of a much larger global conflict. The world is divided between different nations, and Eldians — people who can become Titans — are feared and oppressed. Eren Yeager, once the hero of humanity, now walks a dark path driven by his desire for freedom at any cost.

As Eren gains more power, his actions begin to threaten the entire world. Former friends are forced to choose whether to stand with him or stop him. The lines between hero and villain become blurred as each character struggles with their beliefs, guilt, and hopes for the future.

This season is filled with emotional moments, intense battles, and heartbreaking sacrifices. The story explores themes of war, revenge, and the cycle of hatred that keeps repeating through history. Attack on Titan’s Final Season challenges viewers to think deeply about freedom, morality, and the price of peace, making it one of the most powerful conclusions in anime history.
